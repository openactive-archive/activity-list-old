# OpenActive Activity List

This repository holds the data and documentation for the OpenActive list of physical activities.

A Physical Activity is an exercise, sport or other form of bodily movement that involves physical effort. 
Physical activities include not just sports, but also a variety of forms of exercise and fitness classes. 
An Activity List defines a list of physical activities.

A standardised activity list, that provides unique identifiers, labels and descriptions for physical activities can:

* support integration of data published by multiple activity providers
* improve user experience across applications through use of a standard set of activity names and definitions
* enable better discovery and recommendation tools to enable participants to find more opportunities to be active

The list is publicly available at [https://www.openactive.io/activity-list/](https://www.openactive.io/activity-list/).

## Dataset Documentation

The dataset is structured according to the [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) standard for publishing controlled vocabularies.

It consists of:

* a list of terms with an identifier (a URI) and a preferred label (`skos:prefLabel`)
* relationships between terms (`skos:broader` and `skos:narrower`)
* alternative labels (synonyms, `skos:altLabel`)

### Identifiers

Terms in the list have been assigned a UUID to generate a unique identifier. The URIs for each terms are [Patterned URIs](http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/patterned-uris.html) 
that combine these UUIDs with a common prefix:

E.g. Fencing has been assigned a UUID of `92808e60-820c-4ee2-89ec-ea8d99d3f528`. It's URI is `http://openactive.io/activity-list/#92808e60-820c-4ee2-89ec-ea8d99d3f528`

### JSON-LD

The [JSON-LD version of the list](https://www.openactive.io/activity-list/activity-list.jsonld) provides a simple JSON version of the list that conforms to the [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/) specification.

## Publication process

The master ('canonical') version of the Activity List is that found at [https://www.openactive.io/activity-list/](https://www.openactive.io/activity-list/). That list is generated by [iQvoc](http://iqvoc.net/). The JSON-LD activity list found in this repository is pulled daily from that list, and is intended simply as a backup and to provide a static representation for developers and others who might find this useful.
